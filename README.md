Custom movie riffs managed from your web browser.


# Why WebRiffs?

Have you ever watched _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ or _Riff Tracks_ and thought, "Hey, I could do that!" but didn't have the tools to record your comments?  Well now you can!

WebRiffs allows you to create your own comments to a film (with time markers), and share them with friends.  You can even collaborate with friends to create community comments.

# What's Required

WebRiffs runs on PHP and MySQL, and uses the browser to manage and maintain a repository of comments.
