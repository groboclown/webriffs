    Welcome to WebRiffs!

    <p>WebRiffs allows for community created comments for films,
    that can be watched with the movie.</p>
    
    <p>
    As this is a very early release, the web pages are just bare-bones.
    However, the major functionality exists for the main uses of the
    tool.

    <em>This site uses a heavy dose of JavaScript, so the initial load may take
    a little while.  It can also allow for
    voice input to create your comments, but you'll need both a microphone
    and a web browser that supports voice input; at the moment, only
    Chrome supports the voice input.</em>
