<div>
    Welcome to WebRiffs!
</div>

<div>
    <p>WebRiffs allows for community created comments for films,
    that can be watched with the movie.</p>
    
    <p>
    As this is a very early release, the web pages are just bare-bones.
    However, the major functionality exists for the main uses of the
    tool.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <a href="main.html">Enter WebRiffs!</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <em>This site uses a heavy dose of JavaScript, so the initial load may take
    a little while.  It can also allow for
    voice input to create your comments, but you'll need both a microphone
    and a web browser that supports voice input; at the moment, only
    Chrome supports the voice input.</em>
    </p>
    
    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Select the video you want to comment on.  This is a name with a release
        year.  <em>Videos that have an online version, such as YouTube or
        Vimeo, will have the comments be in sync with the online version.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
        Select the specific branch you want to use.  You may choose an existing
        branch or create a new one.  Different branches have
        different focuses - perhaps one on making riffs, and another for
        noting landmarks.  Branches also are used for different editions of
        a movie - each <em>Blade Runner</em> cut should be in its own branch,
        because the timings between the versions are different.
        </li>
        <li>
        Play back the comments with the video.  If you're watching an online
        video, the comments will be in sync with the playback.  If you're
        watching a different format (DVD, streaming TV, BetaMax, etc.), you'll
        need to keep the playback and video timing in sync.  <em>That's a
        lesson in and of itself.  Be sure to select the media formats
        correctly.  You can also use the time adjustment buttons to fine tune
        the playback as it happens.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
        Have a comment you wish to add?  Start editing!  You'll need to be
        logged in to do this.  Note that the changes you make will be only
        visible by you until you commit the changes.  If you don't like the
        changes you've made, you can abandon them.
        </li>
    </ol>
