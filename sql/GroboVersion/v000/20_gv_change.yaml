# Stores the changed items.  It can be in one of three states:
# - Committed - the change is put into the branch and can be publicly viewed.
# - Pending - the change is being altered by one individual, and usually can't
#     be seen by others.
# - Deleted - the pending change was committed, causing a new committed change
#     to be added, and the old one was removed.
