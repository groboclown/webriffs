# Stores the full parent history for a film version.  This allows us to
# create a view of all the quips that this film version has.  This is a
# combination of the FILM_VERSION parent + all the parents of that film
# version.  All film versions have at least one row in this table, that
# is the film version itself (parent = film id).  If a film version has
# a parent, but only one record in this table, then that means that the
# film version was copied, not forked.

# Love that comment formatting!
