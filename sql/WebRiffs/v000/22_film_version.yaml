# Stores a specific list of quips for a film.  A film can have many different
# versions.  The app will need to be able to manage version operations
# (merge, fork, etc).  A parented film version means that it overrides the
# parent quips.  A transparent parent means that all quips in the parent that
# are not overridden by the child will be visible.
