SQL Formats
===========

The SQL files are stored in [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/) formatted
YAML files, which allows for easy creation of upgradable database files.

Each table is stored in its own file.


Conventions
===========

All table names are _singular_ and in _upper case_.

All column names are in mixed case with underlines separating the words.
