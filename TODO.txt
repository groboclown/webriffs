Internal TODO list (in relative order):

Create data initialization web page for test setup.  This should only be
copied into the output directory when the "test_setup" build target
is used.

Film quip editing, saving, and loading.

Access rules.  The schema support is there, it just needs some code to
support it.

Add per-user change handling.  The schema is basically there, it just needs
to have UI coding and the php side support.

Client-side error handling is in a primitive state.  It needs more robust
handling of issues with  the server.

Access control for branch owners and site admins.  Should be done at a
global level and at a per-user level.

The whole site needs styling.  That'll come much later on, as right now
we're concerned about getting the basic functionality first.
