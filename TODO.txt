Internal TODO list (in relative order):

Client-side error handling is in a primitive state.  It needs more robust
handling of issues with the server.  This needs to have better high level
support for all JSon loaded objects.  Perhaps have a parent class to better
handle it in a common way.

Film quip editing, saving, and loading.

Create new film branches.

Add per-user change handling.  The schema is basically there, it just needs
to have UI coding and the php side support.

Access control for branch owners and site admins.  Should be done at a
global level and at a per-user level.

Admin hard editing of branches.  This should be an extension of the access
controls, along with perhaps hard branch deletion.

Need cron jobs that clean up the really old temporary data from the database,
such as old CSRF tickets or session data.

User banning and banning by IP.

The whole site needs styling.  That'll come much later on, as right now
we're concerned about getting the basic functionality first.
