Internal TODO list (in relative order):

Create data initialization web page for test setup.  This should only be
copied into the output directory when the "test_setup" build target
is used.

Film quip editing, saving, and loading.

Create new film branches.

Check if the CSRF support is actually helping security, or if it just is
another server request and database filler.

Access rules.  The schema support is there, it just needs some code to
support it.

Add per-user change handling.  The schema is basically there, it just needs
to have UI coding and the php side support.

Client-side error handling is in a primitive state.  It needs more robust
handling of issues with  the server.

Access control for branch owners and site admins.  Should be done at a
global level and at a per-user level.

Admin hard editing of branches.  This should be an extension of the access
controls, along with perhaps hard branch deletion.

Need cron jobs that clean up the really old temporary data from the database,
such as old CSRF tickets or session data.

User banning and banning by IP.

The whole site needs styling.  That'll come much later on, as right now
we're concerned about getting the basic functionality first.
